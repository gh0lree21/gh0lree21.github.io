      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I am a software engineering student. 
        I am currently building a portfolio that I am going to be presenting to future employers. 
        My website will contain a showcase of the work I have accomplished both on my own and in teams.
        When I apply for a job or graduate school my goal is to be able to say, “Here’s my portfolio website. I took part in 
        the creation of everything on it, including the website itself.” You want to see what I can do? Go to my “Genesis” website 
        and see how I have grown, that I am proud of my work, I’m diversified, and I love it when a plan comes together. 
        </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The umbrella audience for this website will be anyone who I will want to showcase my work for. The two main audiences, however
        consist of future employers and graduate schools. It is a tall order when I consider what this website could become for me
        because of this audience. They will want to see organization, diversity, and purpose. This will need to be easy to navigate and will need
        to contain concise details about different projects I have completed. It will need to be formal but still show my personality. 
        The audience will be viewing through a professional lense and they will want to know the details quickly.

      <!-- --------Content Section -------------- -->
      <hr>
      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <h4>A Touch of Beauty</h4>
      <p>
        Here’s a thought, I could put letters of recommendation and quotes from mentors and teachers on some different pages 
        of the site! 
      </p>
      <h4>Purpose</h4>
      <p>
        'Hi, if you're here looking for Grant Holley, you've come to the right place. I've created
        this site as a place that you can get to know me better. So take a seat, find your reading
        glasses, and let's get started.'
        The obvious action that I will want people to do as a result of this is to choose me for the job, or school or homie. 
        Is there some way that I could create an action that someone could complete while on the website that would get them already conceding 
        to choosing me? Maybe a button on the home page could have wording like “Choose Me!” lol
        Likelihood of Use - To be honest, I will likely have a portfolio put together on another platform that I will submit with this website. 
        An employer may choose to use the website over a folder because of a hyperlink perhaps. If I structure the website correctly, it may 
        even be easier to view my work. 
      </p>
      <h4>Buttons</h4>
      <p>
        Have a button or two that lead to other pages on the website. Perhaps the call to action for the home page could be 
        a button to the bio or the employer section? I’m going to want multiple buttons in multiple plays to allow people to easy navigate 
        between the different pages of the site. I in no way want them to feel trapped on a page. That could be a way of portraying an 
        ‘open book’ feeling. 

      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
        <img src="images/hello-min.jpg" alt="hello banner">
        <img src="images/handshake.jpg" alt="handshake">

      </ul>
      <h3>Employers</h3>
      <h4>Who am I? (as a potential employee)</h4>
      <p>
        People will be asking, ‘Who is Grant Holley?’ ‘Why does he think I should hire him?’ 
        ‘Does he meet the criteria for the job he is applying for?’ Critical thinkers will come to my site with industry knowledge and 
        immediately begin seeking answers to how I code, if I’m adaptable, etc. This would be my first impression. My virtual 
        handshake as it were (I may want to take an idea or two from Handshake as I organize data about myself). 
      </p>
      <h4>Strategies for Selling Myself</h4>
      <p>
        So how do I make it easy to choose me? Contact info? I don’t love that idea, but it does 
        alright for sure. The website also needs to be general enough that I don’t need to go in and adjust it for every potential 
        employer who views it, so I need to be well represented, concise and I need to keep information relevant to different pages 
        clearly separate so that people who go to the site can easily get exactly the information they are looking for. I could find 
        some of the things that define me as a person and try to find ways to convey that in the website.
      </p>
      <h4>External Files and Links</h4>
      <p>
        Primarily the visitors to my site will be going to external files or sites to view projects in 
        my portfolio. As such, the links that I use will need to be “the point” of the page and I will want to make them obvious. 
        At the same time, if people feel like they have to navigate through a maze to get to the information they want, that will 
        turn them off as well. I will want to supply as much information as possible on the website itself. 
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Personal Bio</h3>
      <h4>Fun Personal Info</h4>
      <p>
        Ultimately, the site is going to be a reflection on me. People will be asking, ‘Who is Grant Holley?’ I want
        to give them an opportunity to get some of my personality, but I don’t want to bog down the official introduction of myself either. 
        Having a page dedicated to the fun side of myself would give people who visit an opportunity to learn some more about me, but only 
        if they want. It would hopefully convey the fact that I can be business and I can be fun. 
      </p>
      <h4>Personal Info</h4>
      <p>
        There is going to be some pretty personal information on the site about myself. I will likely include diplomas and 
        other details (speaking of which I should try to include my associate’s degree diploma). I will also have to be careful what I put 
        on there… to make it personal but since it will be a public website, to not give out any information that could be damaging.

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        Top image will be the hello picture. Bottom two images will likely be 
        icon pictures that will either be links or have links beneath them.
        Footer contains link to home. The icons or pictures will be a sign for LinkedIn,
        Facebook, and Handshake?
      </p>

      <h3>Employers</h3>
      <p>         
        Three images will be relating to python projects, web design projects, team projects
        The two images in the grey box will be images of the universities I attended

      <h3>Bio</h3>
      <p>         
        Top picture likely mountains, second picture is family with a short intro, last piece
        is some "need to know" things about me.
